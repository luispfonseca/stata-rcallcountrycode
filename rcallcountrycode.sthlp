{pstd}
{cmd:rcallcountrycode} uses {browse "https://github.com/haghish/rcall":rcall} to interact with the R package {browse "https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode":countrycode}. It is a substitute for the {cmd:kountry} package from SSC.
There are two main advantages of {cmd:rcallcountrycode}: 1) {browse "https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode":countrycode} is more up to date and has more functions than {cmd:kountry}; 2) it also faster when dealing with large datasets (but not for small ones). The main disadvantage is that it requires more dependencies, including having R installed. See {browse "https://github.com/luispfonseca/rcallcountrycode"} for more information.

I'd like to thank the authors of both packages. {browse "https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode":countrycode} was written by Vincent Arel-Bundock, Nils Enevoldsen, and CJ Yetman. {browse "https://github.com/haghish/rcall":rcall} was written by E. F. Haghish.
